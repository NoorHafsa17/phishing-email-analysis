# phishing-email-analysis

This repository contains a structured phishing email analysis conducted as part of a cybersecurity learning initiative. The project simulates a real-world phishing investigation, focusing on identifying spoofed email attributes, suspicious URLs, header anomalies, and manipulation tactics commonly used in social engineering attacks.

---

## Objective

To investigate a sample phishing email and highlight common indicators of malicious intent, including:

- Impersonated sender domains
- Mismatched or deceptive URLs
- Email header inconsistencies
- Urgent or fear-inducing language
- Unprofessional tone and formatting

The goal of this project is to enhance email threat detection and documentation skills in the context of real-world cybersecurity challenges.

---

## Scope of Work

- Selected a publicly available sample phishing email
- Identified spoofed sender address and domain impersonation
- Analyzed email headers using MXToolbox to detect SPF/DKIM/DMARC failures
- Evaluated embedded URLs using VirusTotal and URLScan.io
- Interpreted the use of urgency and social engineering language
- Summarized the phishing indicators in a structured report
